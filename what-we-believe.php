        <h2>Our Statement of Faith</h2>
        
        <h3>About God</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                1. We believe in one God, Creator of all things, holy, infinitely perfect, and eternally existing in a loving unity of                     three equally divine Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Having limitless knowledge and sovereign power, God                 has graciously purposed from eternity to redeem a people for Himself and to make all things new for His own glory.     
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About The Bible</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                2. We believe that God has spoken in the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, through the words of human authors. As                   the verbally inspired Word of God, the Bible is without error in the original writings, the complete revelation of His will                 for salvation, and the ultimate authority by which every realm of human knowledge and endeavor should be judged. Therefore,                 it is to be believed in all that it teaches, obeyed in all that it requires, and trusted in all that it promises.   
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About The Human Condition</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                3. We believe that God created Adam and Eve in His image, but they sinned when tempted by Satan. In union with Adam, human                 beings are sinners by nature and by choice, alienated from God, and under His wrath. Only through God’s saving work in                     Jesus Christ can we be rescued, reconciled and renewed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About Jesus</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                4. We believe that Jesus Christ is God incarnate, fully God and fully man, one Person in two natures. Jesus—Israel's                        promised Messiah—was conceived through the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life, was crucified                  under Pontius Pilate, arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father as our                  High Priest and Advocate. 

            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About The Work of Christ</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                5. We believe that Jesus Christ, as our representative and substitute, shed His blood on the cross as the perfect, all-                     sufficient sacrifice for our sins. His atoning death and victorious resurrection constitute the only ground for salvation.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About The Holy Spirit</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                6. We believe that the Holy Spirit, in all that He does, glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ. He convicts the world of its                     guilt. He regenerates sinners, and in Him they are baptized into union with Christ and adopted as heirs in the family of                   God. He also indwells, illuminates, guides, equips and empowers believers for Christ-like living and service.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About The Church</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                7. We believe that the true church comprises all who have been justified by God's grace through faith alone in Christ                       alone. They are united by the Holy Spirit in the body of Christ, of which He is the Head. The true church is manifest in                   local churches, whose membership should be composed only of believers. The Lord Jesus mandated two ordinances, baptism and                 the Lord’s Supper, which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when                         celebrated by the church in genuine faith, these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer. 
            </p>

        <h3>About Christian Living</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                8. We believe that God's justifying grace must not be separated from His sanctifying power and purpose. God commands us to                 love Him supremely and others sacrificially, and to live out our faith with care for one another, compassion toward the                     poor and justice for the oppressed. With God’s Word, the Spirit’s power, and fervent prayer in Christ’s name, we are to                     combat the spiritual forces of evil. In obedience to Christ’s commission, we are to make disciples among all people, always                 bearing witness to the gospel in word and deed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About Christ’s Return</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                9. We believe in the personal and bodily return of our Lord Jesus Christ. The coming of Christ, at a time known only to                     God, demands constant expectancy and, as our blessed hope, motivates the believer to godly living, sacrificial service and                 energetic mission. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>About Response and Eternal Destiny</h3>
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                10. We believe that God commands everyone everywhere to believe the gospel by turning to Him in repentance and receiving                   the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that God will raise the dead bodily and judge the world, assigning the unbeliever to                     condemnation and eternal conscious punishment and the believer to eternal blessedness and joy with the Lord in the new                     heaven and the new earth, to the praise of His glorious grace. Amen.
