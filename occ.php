            <p><strong>Operation Christmas Child is a project of the international relief organization, Samaritan’s Purse.
                The mission is to provide local partners around the world with shoeboxes filled with small gifts,
                personal hygiene items, school supplies and toys as a means of reaching out to children in their own
                communities with the Good News of Jesus Christ.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bradford Evangelical Free Church has served as the local Drop-Off location for Operation Christmas
                Child since 2012.  These shoeboxes are then gathered and processed and then shipped all over the world
                to <strong>children affected by war, poverty, natural disaster, famine and disease; and as well to children
                living on Native American reservations in the U.S.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                These shoe box gifts are collected during National Collection Week.  This “Week” always spans from Monday
                to Monday the week prior to Thanksgiving.
            </p>
