                    <p>J Donald Dacey has been the pastor of BEFC since 1999.
                    Donald spent the first half of his adult life in business in Europe, the Middle East and in the US. 
                    It was while living in Europe that he came to faith (Francis Schaeffer being instrumental in that transition).
                      He and Mary then decided to take a sabbatical and study at Westminster Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School.
                       Which led to a different calling ... into the pastorate and BEFC. 
                       They have three children: Alastair, Jamieson and Elizabeth Blair (and two grandchildren).
