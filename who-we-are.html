            Bradford EFC is a congregational church with local decision-making but at the

            same time (and very gladly) a part of a larger church movement, The Evangelical

            Free* Church of America. <a href="https://www.efca.org/explore">https://www.efca.org/explore</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            *What’s this <b>“Free Church”</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, “Free Church” has <b>two</b> primary meanings:
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Firstly</u>, it refers to a congregational form of church government with authority

            residing in the congregation. This reflects the biblical insight that “we are the

            church” – every believer being a vital and participating member of the local Body

            of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Church history this has often been distinguished from a more hierarchical form

            of local church government or a local church under direct denominational

            authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Secondly</u>, the “Free church” refers to a strong separation of church and state

            tradition. It arose in Europe in reaction to the “established” churches which

            sometimes, in return for being granted monopoly status by the state, would

            gradually forfeit their integrity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>The `business’ of the church:</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>…To equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,

            until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,

            to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that

            we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by

            every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.

            Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is

            the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by

            every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes

                the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. (Eph 4:12-16)</i>
